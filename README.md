# FistBump

FistBump is a software engineering exercise in which we created a small app to keep track of job applications and applicants, attempting to mimic the functionality of Handshake, from which we derived the name. The app is completely offline, and runs in the terminal. This was before I had learned good practices for packaging java classes, so compile with javac *.java
